        <h3>2.3.1 - Using Text Files for Input and Output</h3>
        <p>In programming, text files are often used to store and retrieve data. This allows programs to handle data that doesn't need to be hardcoded in the source code. There are basic operations you can perform on text files: opening, reading, writing, and closing files.</p>

        <h4>Opening Files</h4>
        <p>To work with a file, it must first be opened. The <code>open()</code> function is used to open a file in different modes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Read mode:</strong> <code>open("file.txt", "r")</code> - Opens the file for reading. If the file does not exist, it raises an error.</li>
            <li><strong>Write mode:</strong> <code>open("file.txt", "w")</code> - Opens the file for writing. If the file doesn't exist, it creates a new file. If it does exist, it overwrites the content.</li>
            <li><strong>Append mode:</strong> <code>open("file.txt", "a")</code> - Opens the file for appending. If the file doesn't exist, it creates a new file. This mode does not overwrite existing content.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Reading from Files</h4>
        <p>After opening the file in <code>read</code> mode, you can read the contents of the file using functions like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>read():</strong> Reads the entire file as a single string. Example: <code>content = file.read()</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>readline():</strong> Reads one line at a time. Example: <code>line = file.readline()</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>readlines():</strong> Reads all lines into a list. Example: <code>lines = file.readlines()</code>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Writing to Files</h4>
        <p>To write to a file, you need to open the file in <code>write</code> or <code>append</code> mode. You can use methods like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>write():</strong> Writes a string to the file. Example: <code>file.write("Hello, World!")</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>writelines():</strong> Writes a list of strings to the file. Example: <code>file.writelines(["line 1", "line 2"])</code>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4></h4>
        <p>After performing the necessary operations on a file, it is important to close the file using the <code>close()</code> method. This ensures that all changes are saved and resources are released:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>file.close()</code> - Closes the file after operations are completed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Example Code for File Handling</h4>
        <pre>
    # Example of reading from a file
    with open("file.txt", "r") as file:
        content = file.read()
        print(content)

    # Example of writing to a file
    with open("file.txt", "w") as file:
        file.write("Hello, this is a text file.")
        </pre>
        <p>In the example above, the <code>with</code> statement is used for file handling, which automatically takes care of closing the file after the operations are done, even if errors occur during the process.</p>
