        <h2>8.2 - Threat Mitigation</h2>

        <h3>8.2.1 - CIA Concept</h3>
        <p>The CIA triad stands for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. These three principles are the foundation of information security:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Confidentiality</strong>: Ensures that information is accessible only to those authorized to view it. This is essential to prevent unauthorized users from accessing sensitive or private data, which could include personal information, financial records, or intellectual property. Measures such as <strong>encryption</strong>, <strong>access control lists (ACLs)</strong>, and <strong>data masking</strong> are commonly used to enforce confidentiality. For example, sensitive files can be encrypted so that even if they are intercepted, they cannot be read by unauthorized individuals.</li>
            <li><strong>Integrity</strong>: Guarantees that information remains accurate, complete, and unaltered from its original form. Integrity is vital to maintain trust in the data, especially when it is used for critical decisions. This is achieved through the use of <strong>hashing algorithms</strong>, <strong>digital signatures</strong>, and <strong>error-checking protocols</strong>. For instance, a file’s hash can be checked before and after transmission to ensure it hasn’t been tampered with during transit.</li>
            <li><strong>Availability</strong>: Ensures that information and systems are available when needed, without interruption. Availability focuses on ensuring that systems and data are resilient to disruptions, such as hardware failures, cyber-attacks, or natural disasters. This is accomplished by implementing <strong>load balancing</strong>, <strong>fault tolerance</strong>, <strong>backup systems</strong>, and <strong>disaster recovery protocols</strong>. For example, having a backup server or a cloud-based storage solution ensures that users can still access critical data even if the primary system goes down.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By focusing on these three core principles, organizations can create a robust security framework that protects sensitive data, prevents unauthorized access, and ensures that critical systems and services remain operational at all times.</p>

        <h3>8.2.2 - Interrelationship of Security Concepts</h3>
        <p>In the realm of cybersecurity, multiple concepts must work in tandem to form a comprehensive security strategy. Each element builds upon the others to protect systems and data from various threats. Let’s explore the relationships:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Security</strong>: Security is the overall practice of safeguarding systems and data against a variety of threats, from cyber-attacks to accidental breaches. A well-structured security system integrates all security elements, including physical and digital measures.</li>
            <li><strong>Identity</strong>: The process of verifying the identity of individuals, systems, or devices before granting them access to sensitive resources. Identity management systems use <strong>authentication methods</strong> like <strong>passwords</strong>, <strong>biometrics</strong>, or <strong>tokens</strong> to ensure that only legitimate users can access protected systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA)</strong>: As highlighted in 8.2.1, these principles are fundamental to securing data and maintaining the trustworthiness of systems. They ensure that information is kept secret, remains trustworthy, and is available when needed.</li>
            <li><strong>Threat</strong>: A threat is any potential danger that could exploit a system’s vulnerabilities to cause damage. This could come in the form of malicious actors, such as hackers or insiders, or natural events, such as a fire or flood. Threats are always evolving, so a proactive approach to security is essential to stay ahead.</li>
            <li><strong>Vulnerability</strong>: Vulnerabilities are weaknesses in a system that can be exploited by threats. These could be software bugs, unsecured network configurations, or poor access controls. Identifying vulnerabilities through regular assessments is a crucial step in reducing the potential for exploitation.</li>
            <li><strong>Risk Management</strong>: Risk management involves identifying, evaluating, and mitigating risks. By assessing potential threats and vulnerabilities, organizations can prioritize their security efforts to address the highest risks. This proactive approach allows businesses to allocate resources more effectively and reduce the likelihood of security breaches.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These concepts are interrelated and must be managed together to maintain a solid security posture. Effective threat mitigation involves managing the relationships between these elements, continuously identifying new threats, and applying appropriate safeguards to minimize risk.</p>

        <h3>8.2.3 - Processes and Procedures to Mitigate Threats</h3>
        <p>Organizations can reduce the likelihood and impact of security breaches by implementing various processes and procedures designed to mitigate threats. These measures cover multiple aspects of system security, from access control to network defense:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Firewalls</strong>: A firewall is a system designed to protect a network from unauthorized access and malicious traffic. It works by inspecting incoming and outgoing data packets and filtering them based on pre-established security rules. There are different types of firewalls, including:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Packet Filtering Firewalls</strong>: These are basic firewalls that inspect the headers of packets, allowing or blocking them based on predetermined rules.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stateful Inspection Firewalls</strong>: These firewalls keep track of the state of active connections and make decisions based on the context of traffic rather than just individual packets.</li>
                    <li><strong>Proxy Firewalls</strong>: A proxy firewall acts as an intermediary between the client and the server, intercepting requests and responses to ensure they comply with security policies.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Firewalls can also be configured to support advanced features such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>NAT (Network Address Translation)</strong>: NAT is a technique used by firewalls to modify the source or destination IP address in IP packet headers. This allows private IP addresses to be mapped to public ones and vice versa. It helps improve security by hiding the internal network structure and prevents direct exposure to external traffic. NAT is commonly used in home and enterprise networks to share a single public IP address among multiple devices while maintaining network security.</li>
                    <li><strong>SMLI (Simple Management Language Interface)</strong>: SMLI is a standardized protocol used by some firewalls and networking equipment to manage and configure devices. It simplifies network management tasks by providing a simple interface for configuring and controlling network devices, including firewalls, through commands and automation. SMLI makes it easier for administrators to configure and maintain security policies across large networks by offering simplified management and reporting capabilities.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <!-- Include other threat mitigation processes and procedures like Anti-virus, Multi-factor Authentication, etc., here as in the previous content -->
        </ul>
