        <h2>1.2 - Algorithms</h2>

        <h3>1.2.1 - Understand what algorithms are and how they are expressed</h3>
        <p><strong>Algorithms:</strong> An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or formula for solving a problem. It is a set of instructions designed to perform a specific task or solve a problem. Algorithms can be expressed in various ways, including natural language, flowcharts, or pseudocode, and they are a critical part of computer science and problem-solving. They help automate tasks, process data, and optimize processes to make them more efficient.</p>

        <h3>1.2.2 - Be able to express an algorithm using flowcharts and pseudocode</h3>
        <p>Flowcharts and pseudocode are common tools used to express algorithms in a structured manner:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Flowcharts:</strong> These are visual diagrams that represent the steps of an algorithm using symbols such as ovals (for start and end), rectangles (for processes), diamonds (for decision points), and arrows (for the flow of control). Flowcharts help to visually map out the logic of an algorithm.</li>
            <li><strong>Pseudocode:</strong> Pseudocode is a written, human-readable description of the steps in an algorithm. It is not tied to any specific programming language, and it uses simple, structured English-like statements to describe each step of the algorithm. It is often used for planning an algorithm before coding.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.2.3 - Be able to write algorithms that make use of programming constructs</h3>
        <p>Algorithms often make use of basic programming constructs, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sequence:</strong> A series of steps executed in order, one after another.</li>
            <li><strong>Selection:</strong> A decision-making process where different actions are taken based on conditions (e.g., using IF statements, which allow the algorithm to make decisions based on whether a condition is true or false).</li>
            <li><strong>Iteration:</strong> Repeating a set of instructions multiple times (e.g., using FOR loops or WHILE loops to repeat actions until a certain condition is met).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.2.4 - Understand the purpose of a given algorithm</h3>
        <p>The purpose of an algorithm is to solve a specific problem or accomplish a particular task. Whether it’s sorting data, finding the shortest path in a graph, or processing input, every algorithm is designed with an end goal in mind. Understanding the purpose of an algorithm helps to choose the right approach for the problem and ensure the algorithm is both efficient and effective.</p>

        <h3>1.2.5 - Be able to determine the correct output of an algorithm</h3>
        <p>To determine the correct output of an algorithm, you must understand the problem it is solving, the inputs it receives, and how it processes those inputs. By tracing the algorithm step-by-step (either manually or through simulation), you can determine if the expected output is achieved. In programming, debugging and testing can also help verify that the output matches the intended results.</p>

        <h3>1.2.6 - Be able to identify and correct errors in an algorithm</h3>
        <p>Errors in an algorithm may occur due to incorrect logic, faulty assumptions, or improper handling of inputs. To identify and correct errors, you can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Test the algorithm:</strong> Run the algorithm with different inputs to observe if it produces the correct output. Test for edge cases and unusual inputs to identify potential flaws.</li>
            <li><strong>Trace the algorithm:</strong> Manually walk through the algorithm step by step to see if the logic flows correctly and identify where it deviates from the expected behavior.</li>
            <li><strong>Review the pseudocode or flowchart:</strong> Sometimes errors in algorithms are easier to spot when expressed in a more structured format. This helps identify logical inconsistencies or missed conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Modify the algorithm:</strong> Once an error is found, adjust the algorithm’s steps or logic to correct the mistake, ensuring that it functions correctly for all possible cases.</li>
        </ul>
