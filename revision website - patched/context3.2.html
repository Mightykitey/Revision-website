        <h3>3.2.1 - Impact of Developments in Digital Technologies</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Internet of Things (IoT):</strong> The interconnection of everyday physical devices, such as household appliances, vehicles, and wearable devices, with sensors, software, and the internet. This allows them to collect and exchange data, creating a network of devices that can communicate and interact autonomously, improving convenience, efficiency, and accessibility.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL):</strong> 
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>AI:</strong> Refers to the development of systems that can perform tasks requiring human intelligence, such as problem-solving, decision-making, and speech recognition.</li>
                    <li><strong>ML:</strong> A subset of AI that focuses on developing algorithms that allow machines to learn from data without explicit programming. It uses statistical methods to improve its performance over time as more data becomes available.</li>
                    <li><strong>DL:</strong> A subfield of ML that uses neural networks with many layers (deep networks) to analyze large amounts of data and make highly accurate predictions, often used in image recognition, speech processing, and autonomous driving.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR):</strong> 
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>AR:</strong> Enhances the real world with digital overlays such as images, sounds, or other sensory inputs, allowing users to interact with both the physical and digital worlds simultaneously (e.g., Pok√©mon Go).</li>
                    <li><strong>VR:</strong> Creates a completely immersive, computer-generated environment that simulates a real or imagined world. Users typically interact with VR through specialized equipment like headsets and gloves (e.g., Oculus Rift).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
