        <h2>6.3 - Data Systems</h2>

        <h3>6.3.1 - Understand the features and functions of data systems and their importance to organisations:</h3>
        <p>Data systems are essential tools for organizations to manage, process, and derive value from the vast amounts of data they collect. They play a crucial role in streamlining operations and decision-making. Below are the key features and functions that define modern data systems:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Wrangling</strong>: This refers to the process of cleaning, structuring, and enriching raw data into a usable format. Data wrangling involves:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Structure</strong>: Organizing data into consistent formats for easier analysis.</li>
                    <li><strong>Clean</strong>: Removing errors, inconsistencies, or duplicate entries from data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Enrich</strong>: Adding relevant context or data from external sources to enhance the dataset.</li>
                    <li><strong>Validate</strong>: Ensuring the data is accurate and conforms to predefined rules or standards.</li>
                    <li><strong>Output</strong>: Preparing the data for further analysis or integration into business processes.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Core Functions of Data Systems</strong>: The following are the fundamental tasks that data systems handle:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Input</strong>: The process of capturing or importing data from various sources into the system.</li>
                    <li><strong>Search</strong>: The ability to retrieve specific data based on queries, often through indexing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Save</strong>: Storing data securely and efficiently for future access and analysis.</li>
                    <li><strong>Integrate</strong>: Combining data from various sources to create a unified dataset or enable cross-platform analysis.</li>
                    <li><strong>Organize (Index)</strong>: Structuring data for easy access and efficient querying, often using indexing or database schemas.</li>
                    <li><strong>Output</strong>: Delivering processed data or insights to end-users or systems for further action.</li>
                    <li><strong>Feedback Loop</strong>: Continuously refining data collection, processing, and analysis based on user feedback and new insights.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Data Entry and Maintenance</strong>: Data systems need to be maintained to ensure that data is accurate, up-to-date, and easy to input. Challenges include:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Online Data Entry</strong>: The process of entering data through digital interfaces, often in real-time. Common in e-commerce, customer support, and content management.</li>
                    <li><strong>Risk of Data Entry Errors</strong>: Human or system errors during entry can lead to inaccurate data, which may affect decision-making and reporting.</li>
                    <li><strong>Time to Create Data Entry Screens</strong>: Designing user-friendly, efficient data entry forms is critical to reducing errors and time spent entering data.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Visualisation</strong>: Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data, making it easier to understand and analyze. Common forms include:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Graphs/Charts</strong>: Line graphs, bar charts, pie charts, etc., for visualizing trends, comparisons, and distributions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Tables</strong>: Structured tables to organize data for easy reading and reference.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reports</strong>: Summary documents that interpret data and provide actionable insights.</li>
                    <li><strong>Infographics</strong>: Visual representations combining data with graphic design to convey complex information clearly and attractively.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>6.3.2 - Understand the purpose of business information tools and their use in business:</h3>
        <p>Business information tools enable organizations to analyze data and generate insights that drive informed decision-making. These tools enhance operational efficiency and strategic planning. Some key business information tools include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Business Intelligence (BI) Software</strong>: Tools like Power BI, Tableau, and Qlik Sense that allow businesses to aggregate, analyze, and visualize data from various sources to make informed decisions.</li>
            <li><strong>Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Systems</strong>: Platforms like Salesforce and HubSpot that track and manage customer interactions, helping businesses improve sales, customer service, and marketing efforts.</li>
            <li><strong>Financial Planning Systems</strong>: Tools for managing budgets, forecasting, and financial reporting, which help organizations optimize their financial resources and maintain financial health.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By using these tools, organizations can improve efficiency, track performance, and respond more effectively to market changes.</p>

        <h3>6.3.3 - Understand the features of different data models and how organisations use them to organise data:</h3>
        <p>Data models are frameworks that describe how data is structured and related within a system. Different models are used depending on the complexity of the data, the relationships between entities, and the intended use of the system. Here are the main types of data models:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Conceptual Data Model</strong>: A high-level model that defines the data entities and their relationships but does not go into technical detail. It is used to understand the overall structure of the data without focusing on implementation.</li>
            <li><strong>Logical Data Model</strong>: A more detailed model that outlines the structure of the data, such as tables, fields, and relationships. It focuses on how data is logically organized but does not define how it will be physically stored.</li>
            <li><strong>Physical Data Model</strong>: The most detailed model, which specifies how data will be stored in a database system. It includes information about indexing, data types, and storage structures.</li>
            <li><strong>Hierarchical Database Model</strong>: A model where data is organized into a tree-like structure, where each record has a single parent. It is used in legacy systems and is suitable for applications with a clear, hierarchical relationship (e.g., organizational charts).</li>
            <li><strong>Relational Model</strong>: The most common data model used in modern databases, where data is organized into tables with rows and columns. Relationships are defined using keys (primary and foreign). This model is used in relational database management systems (RDBMS) like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Choosing the appropriate data model depends on the complexity of the data and the system's needs. A conceptual model is useful in the early stages of system design, while a physical model is necessary for database implementation.</p>
