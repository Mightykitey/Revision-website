        <h2>7.3 - Virtual Environments</h2>
        
        <h3>7.3.1 â€“ Understand the Key Features of Virtual Environments</h3>
        <p>
            Virtual environments are foundational to modern IT infrastructure, enabling organizations to run and manage applications, workloads, and services with greater flexibility, efficiency, and security. These environments replicate physical hardware and systems through software, allowing for powerful capabilities in areas such as data management, networking, server operations, desktop delivery, and operating system execution.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Types of virtualisation</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Network virtualisation</strong> transforms a physical network into software based network. The network services service then become disconnected from the hardware andseveral hardware networks can be combined and organised to suit the workload</li>
            <li><strong>Server virtualisation</strong> Allows a single server to be divided into several virtual server each having it's own operating system and being able to perform multiple function</li>
            <li><strong>data virtualisation</strong> allows an application to work with data from a variety of sources in a variety of formats without needing technical details about the data</li>
            <li><strong>Desktop virtualisation</strong> is software that hosts simulated desktop and applications in a data centre, allowing users to access resources from a remote devices</li>
            <li><strong>OS virtualisation</strong> Run mutiplie OS on one machine</li>
        </ul>

        
        <h4>1. Data Virtualization</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Increased Security:</strong> Access controls and data masking techniques can be centrally applied to protect sensitive data across multiple sources.</li>
            <li><strong>Sharing:</strong> Different departments and applications can access the same logical data model without duplicating datasets.</li>
            <li><strong>Aggregation:</strong> Combines structured and unstructured data from various systems for unified access and analytics.</li>

            <li><strong>Increased Security:</strong> Virtual networks can be segmented with firewalls and encryption, reducing the attack surface.</li>
            <li><strong>Managed Execution:</strong> Software-defined networking (SDN) enables dynamic management of network traffic and services.</li>
            <li><strong>Sharing:</strong> Multiple services or tenants can share the same physical network securely.</li>
            <li><strong>Isolation:</strong> Virtual networks operate independently, preventing issues in one from affecting others.</li>
            <li><strong>Portability:</strong> Virtual networks can be migrated across cloud environments with consistent policies.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>3. Server Virtualization</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Increased Security:</strong> VMs are isolated, so if one is compromised, others are unaffected.</li>
            <li><strong>Managed Execution:</strong> Hypervisors manage resource allocation and system execution.</li>
            <li><strong>Sharing:</strong> Physical resources are efficiently shared by multiple VMs.</li>
            <li><strong>Aggregation:</strong> Multiple physical servers can be consolidated into a single virtualized environment.</li>
            <li><strong>Emulation:</strong> VMs can simulate different hardware setups for flexibility.</li>
            <li><strong>Isolation:</strong> VMs operate independently, ideal for testing and multi-tenant setups.</li>
            <li><strong>Portability:</strong> VMs can be moved between hosts or data centers with minimal disruption.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>4. Desktop Virtualization</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Increased Security:</strong> Data remains on centralized servers; endpoints only display user interfaces.</li>
            <li><strong>Managed Execution:</strong> IT administrators centrally manage OS updates and apps.</li>
            <li><strong>Sharing:</strong> One host server can support many virtual desktops.</li>
            <li><strong>Isolation:</strong> Each user gets a personalized, independent environment.</li>
            <li><strong>Portability:</strong> Users can access their desktops from any device or location.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>5. Operating System (OS) Virtualization</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Increased Security:</strong> Containers are sandboxed and isolated from each other and the host.</li>
            <li><strong>Managed Execution:</strong> Orchestrators like Kubernetes manage scaling and resource use.</li>
            <li><strong>Sharing:</strong> Containers share the host OS kernel, minimizing overhead.</li>
            <li><strong>Emulation:</strong> Containers simulate full app environments without needing full VMs.</li>
            <li><strong>Isolation:</strong> Each container runs independently, enabling microservices architecture.</li>
            <li><strong>Portability:</strong> Containers run consistently across various environments.</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>7.3.2 - Understand the benefits and drawbacks of the use of virtual environments for organizations:</h3>
        <p>Virtual environments provide organizations with several strategic advantages, but they also come with their own set of challenges. Below are some of the key benefits and drawbacks of adopting virtual environments in an organizational context:</p>
