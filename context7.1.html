        <h2>7.1 - Physical Environments</h2>

        <h3>7.1.1 - Understand the features and characteristics of different types of physical computer systems:</h3>
        <p>Different types of physical computer systems cater to specific needs in various environments. Understanding their features and characteristics is key to determining the best fit for a particular context or task:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal Computers (PCs)</strong>: These are general-purpose machines designed for individual use. They are typically used for tasks like browsing the internet, word processing, gaming, and multimedia. PCs can vary in performance depending on their components (e.g., CPU, RAM, and GPU).</li>
            <li><strong>Mobile Devices</strong>: Includes smartphones, tablets, and laptops. These devices are portable, offering flexibility for communication, entertainment, and productivity on the go. Mobile devices often come with integrated sensors, touchscreens, and wireless connectivity.</li>
            <li><strong>Servers</strong>: Powerful systems used to manage network resources, store data, host websites, and provide services to other devices (clients) within a network. Servers are typically more robust and designed for long-term reliability and high availability.</li>
            <li><strong>Smart/Internet-enabled Devices</strong>: These devices (often referred to as the Internet of Things or IoT devices) are capable of connecting to the internet and performing specific tasks. Examples include smart thermostats, wearable health trackers, and connected home devices.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>7.1.2 - Understand the features and characteristics of hardware and peripherals:</h3>
        <p>Hardware and peripherals are essential to the functionality of a computer system. They provide input, output, processing, and storage capabilities:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Input Devices</strong>: Devices that allow users to interact with the computer system by providing data or commands. Examples include keyboards, mice, touchpads, scanners, and microphones.</li>
            <li><strong>Output Devices</strong>: Devices that present data to the user in a readable or usable form. Common examples are monitors, printers, speakers, and projectors.</li>
            <li><strong>Processors (CPUs)</strong>: The central processing unit (CPU) is the brain of the computer, responsible for executing instructions and managing tasks. Its performance is determined by factors like clock speed, core count, and architecture.</li>
            <li><strong>Memory</strong>: Includes both primary (RAM) and secondary memory. RAM temporarily holds data being processed, while secondary storage (like hard drives and SSDs) stores data permanently.</li>
            <li><strong>Secondary Storage Devices (Internal and External)</strong>: Devices used to store data permanently. Internal storage (e.g., HDD, SSD) is housed inside the computer, while external storage (e.g., USB drives, external hard drives) provides portability and additional space.</li>
            <li><strong>Motherboard/Mainboard</strong>: The primary circuit board that houses the processor, memory, and other essential components. It connects all the hardware in the system.</li>
            <li><strong>Cooling Systems</strong>: These systems (fans, liquid cooling, heat sinks) are crucial for maintaining safe operating temperatures for the hardware, particularly the CPU and GPU, preventing overheating and performance throttling.</li>
            <li><strong>Sensors</strong>: Embedded sensors enable devices to gather data from the environment, such as temperature, humidity, motion, or proximity. These are often found in mobile devices, smart devices, and autonomous systems.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>7.1.3 - Understand the purpose and functions of software used in computer systems:</h3>
        <p>Software is essential to make hardware functional and usable. It enables users and applications to interact with the physical components of the computer system:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Operating Systems (OS)</strong>: The software that manages hardware resources and provides services for applications. Different types of operating systems include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Batch OS: Processes tasks in batches without user interaction (e.g., old mainframes).</li>
                    <li>Multitasking OS: Allows multiple tasks to run simultaneously (e.g., Windows, Linux).</li>
                    <li>Real-time OS: Ensures immediate processing and response, used in embedded systems (e.g., automotive systems).</li>
                    <li>Network OS: Manages network resources and connectivity (e.g., Windows Server, Linux-based servers).</li>
                    <li>Mobile OS: Optimized for mobile devices with touch interfaces and wireless connectivity (e.g., iOS, Android).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Utility Software</strong>: Programs designed to manage, maintain, or optimize computer systems. Examples include antivirus software, disk management tools, and backup software.</li>
            <li><strong>Application Software</strong>: Programs that perform specific tasks for the user, such as word processors, web browsers, video editors, and games.</li>
            <li><strong>Code Development Tools (IDEs, Debuggers)</strong>: Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and debugging tools assist programmers in writing, testing, and debugging software applications. Examples include Visual Studio, Eclipse, and PyCharm.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>7.1.4 - Understand the benefits and drawbacks of software, hardware, and peripherals in different contexts:</h3>
        <p>In different environments or use cases, the benefits and drawbacks of specific software, hardware, and peripherals can vary:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> Hardware and software allow for efficient processing, communication, and storage. In certain contexts, such as business, robust servers and networked systems provide scalability and high availability. In personal settings, mobile devices offer portability and convenience.</li>
            <li><strong>Drawbacks:</strong> Software and hardware choices can sometimes be limited by factors like compatibility, cost, and power requirements. For example, a high-performance server might be overkill for simple home use, while mobile devices may lack the processing power needed for heavy computing tasks.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>7.1.5 - Understand how physical data storage and recovery systems work:</h3>
        <p>Data storage and recovery systems ensure that data is securely stored and can be recovered in case of failure or loss. These systems help protect critical business and personal data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID)</strong>: A data storage technology that combines multiple physical disk drives into one or more logical units for data redundancy, performance improvement, or both. RAID levels (e.g., RAID 1, RAID 5) vary in terms of data protection and speed.</li>
            <li><strong>Network Attached Storage (NAS)</strong>: A dedicated file storage server connected to a network, allowing multiple users to access and share files. NAS is typically used in small to medium-sized businesses for centralized storage and backup.</li>
            <li><strong>Storage Area Network (SAN)</strong>: A high-speed, dedicated network that provides block-level access to data storage. SANs are typically used by large enterprises to improve storage scalability and performance, often in conjunction with servers and other critical systems.</li>
        </ul>
