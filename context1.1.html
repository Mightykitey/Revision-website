        <h3>1.1.1 - Be able to use top-down, bottom-up, and modularisation approaches to solve problems</h3>
        <p><strong>Top-down:</strong> The top-down approach involves breaking down a system or problem into smaller, more manageable parts, starting from the highest level of abstraction. The goal is to view the problem from a high level and then progressively divide it into smaller tasks that can be handled individually. This method helps in planning and organizing complex tasks before implementation.</p>
        <p><strong>Bottom-up:</strong> The bottom-up approach starts by focusing on the smaller components or details and then gradually combining them to form a larger, more complete system. This method is useful when the solution to a problem is not immediately clear, and it allows you to build a solution incrementally, based on the parts you understand well.</p>
        <p><strong>Modularisation:</strong> Modularisation is the practice of dividing a problem or system into smaller, self-contained modules that can be developed, tested, and understood independently. This approach improves code readability, maintainability, and reusability. Each module performs a specific function and can be combined to solve more complex problems.</p>

        <h3>1.1.2 - Be able to decompose problems by:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Breaking a problem down into smaller, more manageable parts: By breaking a problem into smaller tasks, it becomes easier to address each individual aspect, simplifying the overall process of finding a solution.</li>
            <li>Identifying and describing the main features of a problem or process: Identifying the key components helps to focus on the essential elements of the problem, allowing for a clearer approach to problem-solving.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.1.3 - Be able to use pattern recognition to:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Identify and describe trends and similarities within and between problems and processes: Pattern recognition helps identify recurring issues or trends that could provide insights into solutions, enabling the use of existing knowledge or approaches in new scenarios.</li>
            <li>Identify and describe common features between a given problem and existing solutions: By recognizing similarities between a new problem and previously solved problems, we can adapt existing solutions or modify them to fit the current context.</li>
            <li>Make predictions and assumptions based on identified patterns: Recognizing patterns allows you to make educated guesses or predictions about the outcomes of certain actions, which can guide decision-making and strategy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.1.4 - Be able to use abstraction to:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Identify information that is needed to solve an identified problem: Abstraction helps focus on the core information necessary for solving a problem while ignoring irrelevant details, streamlining the problem-solving process.</li>
            <li>Filter out unnecessary details at different stages of a problem: As problems are decomposed, abstraction allows unnecessary details to be excluded, helping maintain focus on the important elements at each stage of the solution development.</li>
            <li>Create a layer of abstraction appropriate to the stage in the problem-solving process: Different stages of problem-solving may require different levels of abstraction. For example, during planning, you may work at a high level of abstraction, while during implementation, you may need to work with more specific details.</li>
        </ul>
