        <h3>1.1.1 - Be able to use top-down, bottom-up, and modularisation approaches to solve problems</h3>
        <p><strong>Top-down:</strong> The top-down approach involves breaking down a system or problem into smaller, more manageable parts, starting from the highest level of abstraction. The goal is to view the problem from a high level and then progressively divide it into smaller tasks that can be handled individually. This method helps in planning and organizing complex tasks before implementation.</p>
        <p><strong>Bottom-up:</strong> The bottom-up approach starts by focusing on the smaller components or details and then gradually combining them to form a larger, more complete system. This method is useful when the solution to a problem is not immediately clear, and it allows you to build a solution incrementally, based on the parts you understand well.</p>
        <p><strong>Modularisation:</strong> Modularisation is the practice of dividing a problem or system into smaller, self-contained modules that can be developed, tested, and understood independently. This approach improves code readability, maintainability, and reusability. Each module performs a specific function and can be combined to solve more complex problems.</p>

        <h3>1.1.2 - Be able to decompose problems by:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Breaking a problem down into smaller, more manageable parts: By breaking a problem into smaller tasks, it becomes easier to address each individual aspect, simplifying the overall process of finding a solution.</li>
            <li>Identifying and describing the main features of a problem or process: Identifying the key components helps to focus on the essential elements of the problem, allowing for a clearer approach to problem-solving.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Advantages:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The problem can be better understood by breaking it down into simpler parts.</li>
            <li>Each sub-problem can be developed and tested separately, reducing complexity during the development process.</li>
            <li>The overall system becomes more manageable and allows for a clearer approach to finding solutions.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Drawbacks:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>It is essential to fully understand the original problem before decomposition; otherwise, the smaller parts might not address the core issue.</li>
            <li>The sub-problems might not provide a fully functional solution on their own and may need to be re-integrated or re-aligned to the original problem.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.1.3 - Be able to use pattern recognition to:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Identify and describe trends and similarities within and between problems and processes: Pattern recognition helps identify recurring issues or trends that could provide insights into solutions, enabling the use of existing knowledge or approaches in new scenarios.</li>
            <li>Identify and describe common features between a given problem and existing solutions: By recognizing similarities between a new problem and previously solved problems, we can adapt existing solutions or modify them to fit the current context.</li>
            <li>Make predictions and assumptions based on identified patterns: Recognizing patterns allows you to make educated guesses or predictions about the outcomes of certain actions, which can guide decision-making and strategy.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Advantages:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Helps identify recurring problems, which could allow faster identification of solutions from past experiences.</li>
            <li>Allows for efficient problem-solving by recognizing similarities and adapting solutions to new situations.</li>
            <li>Improves prediction and decision-making by identifying trends and patterns that inform actions.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Disadvantages:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Over-reliance on past solutions may lead to missed opportunities or solutions that are not optimal for the current situation.</li>
            <li>Recognizing patterns without careful analysis could lead to assumptions that may not always hold true in every situation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.1.4 - Be able to use abstraction to:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Identify information that is needed to solve an identified problem: Abstraction helps focus on the core information necessary for solving a problem while ignoring irrelevant details, streamlining the problem-solving process.</li>
            <li>Filter out unnecessary details at different stages of a problem: As problems are decomposed, abstraction allows unnecessary details to be excluded, helping maintain focus on the important elements at each stage of the solution development.</li>
            <li>Create a layer of abstraction appropriate to the stage in the problem-solving process: Different stages of problem-solving may require different levels of abstraction. For example, during planning, you may work at a high level of abstraction, while during implementation, you may need to work with more specific details.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Key Features:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Allows you to focus on essential aspects of a problem, simplifying complex problems into manageable tasks.</li>
            <li>Facilitates problem-solving at different levels by removing unnecessary information and honing in on the key details.</li>
            <li>Provides flexibility by allowing different levels of abstraction to be applied at various stages of problem-solving, depending on the task at hand.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Advantages:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Reduces complexity by removing unnecessary details and focusing on what is most important for solving the problem.</li>
            <li>Helps in creating solutions that are flexible and scalable by focusing on generalized patterns and concepts rather than specific details.</li>
            <li>Improves efficiency by reducing cognitive load and enabling a streamlined approach to problem-solving.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Disadvantages:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Over-abstraction can lead to the loss of critical details, which may be important in solving the problem.</li>
            <li>Finding the right level of abstraction can be challenging, as too little or too much abstraction can complicate the process.</li>
            <li>It may be difficult to apply abstraction when the problem is highly specific or involves unique elements that are hard to generalize.</li>
        </ul>
