        <h3>4.1.4 - Equality Act</h3>
        <p>The Equality Act prohibits discrimination based on protected characteristics, ensuring fairness and equality in various contexts, including the workplace and digital environments. It is crucial that employers create inclusive and accessible environments for all individuals.</p>
        <ul>

        <h3>4.1.6 - Monitoring the Workplace with Digital Technologies</h3>
        <p>Monitoring employees through digital technologies raises both ethical and legal concerns. While organizations may track activity for security or productivity reasons, there are laws and guidelines governing how and to what extent they can do so. It's essential to balance business needs with respect for employee privacy.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Video/Audio Surveillance</strong>: Employers may use cameras or microphones for security purposes, but they must ensure that surveillance is done transparently and does not infringe on employee privacy. Any monitoring should be disclosed to employees, and surveillance should only occur in areas where there is a legitimate business need.</li>
            <li><strong>Key Loggers</strong>: Some companies may use key loggers to monitor employee activity. This practice must be done in compliance with data protection laws and should be disclosed to employees. Unauthorized or secretive keylogging is illegal and infringes on employee rights.</li>
            <li><strong>GPS Tracking</strong>: Employers may use GPS tracking for vehicles or mobile employees, but it must be done with consent and within legal boundaries to protect workers' privacy. Tracking should be limited to business-related activities and must not infringe on employees' personal time or space.</li>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cross-border Data Transfers</strong>: International law governs the transfer of data between countries, with agreements like the GDPR establishing strict rules for cross-border data movement. This ensures that personal data is protected, regardless of where it is processed or stored.</li>
            <li><strong>Intellectual Property Protection</strong>: Different countries have varying laws on intellectual property, making it crucial to understand international treaties and agreements that affect digital technologies and innovations. Treaties such as the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works ensure that creators' rights are recognized internationally.</li>
