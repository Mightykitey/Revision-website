        <ul>
            <li><strong>Video/Audio Surveillance</strong>: Employers may use cameras or microphones for security purposes, but they must ensure that surveillance is done transparently and does not infringe on employee privacy. Any monitoring should be disclosed to employees, and surveillance should only occur in areas where there is a legitimate business need.</li>
            <li><strong>Key Loggers</strong>: Some companies may use key loggers to monitor employee activity. This practice must be done in compliance with data protection laws and should be disclosed to employees. Unauthorized or secretive keylogging is illegal and infringes on employee rights.</li>
